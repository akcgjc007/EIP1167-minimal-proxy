# EIP1167: Clone factory with openzeppelin

## How to run?
 - `yarn`: installation
 - `yarn test`: running tests

## Notes from developer
 - `optionality/clone-factory` is not an updated repository and hence the codes can't be used directly.
 - Open this file(`@optionality.io/clone-factory/contracts/CloneFactory.sol`) in the *node_modules* and change the soldity version accordingly.
